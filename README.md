# Purple: a front-end Test Project 

This is a simple front-end project developed to test some knowledges.

## Build & Run

Run 'npm install' to build and 'npm start' to run.

## Testing

Tests was developed using protractor, so you need to start a selenium server (probably in other terminal) with the command 'webdriver-manager start --standalone' and, then, start the test taks with 'gulp e2e-test'.
